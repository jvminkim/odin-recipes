    <ul>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Slice Sandwich Bread</li>
        <li>Few Shakes Salt</li>
        <li>Few slices Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cheese and Strawberry Jam</h4>

        <li>Few slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Small scoop strawberry jam</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Canadian Bacon and Swiss Cheese</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Few Slices Canadian Bacon</li>
        <li>Few Slice Swiss Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4>Prep Ingredients:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut one slice of bread in half.</li>
        <li>Whisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Beat it thoroughly. Season it with few sprinkles of Salt & Black Pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip the bread halves into the egg wash - coat only one side. Briefly set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make Breakfast Sandwich</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place some butter into your frying pan. Place on low heat. Once butter melts and covers the entire pan, add-in the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Immediately place-on the bread halves into the middle of the egg (egg-coated part facing up). Give it a slight nudge so the bread halves settles into the egg. Then do nothing - allow the egg to cook - don't touch it.</li>
        <li>After the egg has set, it should lift easily off the frying pan. Carefully flip it using a spatula. Then fold the eggs that are hanging over the bread inwards to make a rectangular shape.</li>
        <li>Place on your toppings of choice: Cheese & Jam, Ham & Cheese</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the sandwich in half. And give it a few minutes to cook, so that the cheese on the inside will melt.</li>
        <li>Next, place a small dab of butter into the pan. Give both sides about a 30-45 seconds in the butter to get a nice golden crispy top.</li>
        <li>Eat with your hands, or get a knife and fork! Bon Appetit ya'll!</li>
    </ol>
